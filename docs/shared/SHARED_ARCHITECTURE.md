# CourierDash Shared Architecture

Contract version: `0.2.0-draft`
Development phase: `mobile_catch_up`
Contract status: `partially_verified`

## Authority model

The versioned shared contract is the cross-client authority for behavior, data semantics, security expectations, and compatibility. Web source code and the local schema snapshot are evidence; neither silently becomes a shared rule.

Web is a behavioral reference only for a flow confirmed by a versioned snapshot; shared contract; source evidence; verified fixture. Unverified Web behavior is discovery evidence, not automatically canonical business behavior.

Evidence priority is:

1. A verified Staging snapshot tied to an unambiguous environment identity.
2. This versioned contract and its fixtures.
3. Generated database types and repository schema snapshots.
4. Migrations and application source.
5. Reported behavior that has not yet been independently reproduced.

Conflicts do not get resolved by choosing the newest-looking file. They become explicit mismatches or blockers until evidence is reconciled.

## Runtime boundaries

- Web and Mobile are separate clients of one shared domain contract.
- Simple user-owned CRUD may use Supabase directly when RLS is sufficient and the operation has no shared calculation, secret, transaction, or partial-failure risk.
- Shared atomic operations belong in RPCs; privileged integrations and secrets belong in Edge Functions or a future API.
- Client code must never contain elevated server credentials.
- Production is outside the scope of this snapshot and was not inspected or changed.

## Shared domain surface

| Flow | Canonical scope | Current contract state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auth | Email/password signup, login, logout, recovery, session | `reported_pending_snapshot` |
| Profile | One profile per Auth user; nickname uniqueness | `blocked` because creation mechanisms diverge |
| Work | One dated record per user/day, six platforms, recorded metrics | `partially_verified` |
| Statistics | Brutto and platform aggregation | `reported_pending_snapshot` for Mobile |
| Reports | Annual totals and safe averages | `partially_verified` |
| Expenses | Fuel and vehicle rental only | `draft_pending_schema_snapshot` |
| Vehicle rental | Optional dated weekly-price periods | `unresolved` |

## Required client boundaries

- UI layout and navigation may differ, but stored meaning, formulas, ownership, date interpretation, and error outcomes must remain compatible.
- `app_tips` is the canonical domain term. Mobile may expose it as `appTips`; the current database mapping uses per-platform `tips_*` fields.
- A dated work record is not an active shift. Start/stop shift semantics are not currently part of the shared contract.
- Statistics can be complete without Expenses. Expenses and rental do not enter Brutto.
- Income after expenses is a separate future metric and is not tax Netto.

## Evidence and verification

Each material statement carries one of the status values defined in `SCHEMA_POLICY.md`. Remote Staging metadata was not queried because the local target could not be proven to be Staging. Therefore `schemaRevision` and `latestMigration` remain `null`, and any environment-specific claim is reported or blocked rather than verified.

## Change governance

Changes are classified A-D:

- Class A: editorial or evidence-only changes that do not alter machine-readable semantics.
- Class B: additive, optional, backward-compatible fields or capabilities.
- Class C: breaking changes to schema, Auth, RLS, formulas, currency, timezone, rounding, required fields, or stored meaning.
- Class D: urgent security remediation. It may shorten normal migration windows but still requires an incident record, explicit compatibility impact, and follow-up snapshot.

Class C requires a new contract version, migration path, client catch-up gate, fixtures, and Staging verification. Class D requires the same evidence as soon as containment permits.

## Known architectural blockers

- Staging identity cannot be verified from approved local evidence, so remote metadata inspection is blocked.
- The repository contains only two additive migrations and no reproducible bootstrap for the five observed public tables, policies, and base constraints.
- The local schema snapshot reports a nullable ownership field with a concrete default on work records. The value is deliberately redacted from all artifacts.
- Profile creation occurs through more than one Web path, and one signup surface does not provide nickname metadata.
- Device-local Mobile date semantics conflict with Web uses of UTC-derived date strings and JavaScript date parsing.
