# API Contract

Contract version: `0.2.0-draft`
Status: `partially_verified`

## Boundary selection

Use direct Supabase access only for simple CRUD that is owned by the signed-in user, protected by verified RLS, does not require a secret or transaction, does not implement a shared calculation, and cannot leave dependent writes partially completed.

Use an RPC when one operation touches multiple tables, requires atomicity, performs a shared aggregation or calculation, needs idempotency, or contains dependent writes whose partial failure would be unsafe.

Use an Edge Function for external APIs, secrets, webhooks, email delivery, payments, integrations, or privileged side effects.

Introduce a versioned service API when the domain becomes complex, integrations multiply, rate limits or audit trails are required, or orchestration no longer fits a single database transaction.

## Observed Web API inventory

| Surface | Operation | Evidence | Status | Mobile relevance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Auth | Password signup/login/logout/recovery/update | `app/login/page.tsx`, `app/forgot-password/page.tsx`, `app/reset-password/page.tsx`, `app/work/page.tsx` | `partially_verified` | Required |
| `profiles` | Select, insert/upsert | `app/page.tsx`, `app/work/page.tsx` | `partially_verified` | Required; flow blocked |
| `work_shifts` | Select, insert, update, delete | `app/work/page.tsx`, `app/work/year/page.tsx` | `partially_verified` | Required |
| `tax_settings` | Select, insert, update | `app/work/page.tsx` | `partially_verified` | Deferred unless Mobile exposes Web tax calculations |
| `garage_rules` | Select, insert, update, delete | `app/garage/page.tsx` | `partially_verified` | Not equivalent to Expenses |
| `garage_history` | Select, insert | `app/garage/page.tsx` | `partially_verified` | Not equivalent to Expenses |
| RPC | No call sites or generated functions found | `lib/database.types.ts`, repository search | `not_used` | None today |
| Edge Functions | No invocation or function source found | repository search | `not_used` | None today |
| Storage | No Storage calls found | repository search | `not_used` | None today |

The absence statements are repository-local. Remote Staging inventory is `blocked` because the target identity is unverified.

## Work record contract

The current Web operation writes one `work_shifts` row per user and calendar date. The unique `(user_id, date)` constraint is present in local snapshot evidence. Create and update payloads include distance, hours, and platform-specific income, orders, app tips, cash tips, bonuses, plus an optional trimmed custom name for `other`.

Supported platform identifiers are `uber`, `wolt`, `bolt`, `glovo`, `stuart`, and `other`. For `other`, non-zero metrics require a non-empty trimmed name in local migration evidence. Cash tips are non-negative in both Web validation and local constraint evidence. General non-negativity for every other metric is not verified and must not be invented by Mobile.

Web reads all owned rows, performs filters and aggregations client-side, and writes directly. Errors from mutations are surfaced to the UI; several read paths do not expose structured errors. No shared error envelope or retry/idempotency contract exists.

## Profile operation warning

The Web has parallel profile creation paths: signup-time upsert when a session is immediately available, metadata-driven lazy upsert on the Work page, and an interactive nickname prompt. A separate login-page signup does not provide nickname metadata. This is not a single deterministic API contract. Mobile must treat profile bootstrap as blocked until one canonical mechanism and failure policy are accepted.

## Multi-write warning

Garage history insertion followed by a garage-rule update is implemented as two direct client writes. It can partially fail and therefore meets the RPC criteria if it becomes shared Mobile behavior. It is not part of the current shared Expenses or rental contract.
