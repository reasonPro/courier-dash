# Compatibility Policy

Contract version: `0.2.0-draft`
Status: `proposed`

## Compatibility objective

Additive evolution is preferred. Clients may present different interfaces, but they must preserve accepted field meaning, formulas, ownership, date semantics, and failure behavior.

## Rollout sequence

The complete cross-repository ownership and approval route is normative in `SCHEMA_POLICY.md`. Within that route, every shared data or behavior change follows this compatibility lifecycle:

1. Expand the contract and backend with backward-compatible capability.
2. Migrate clients while old behavior remains supported.
3. Verify Web and Mobile against the same Staging snapshot and fixtures.
4. Deprecate the old capability with an explicit end condition.
5. Remove it only after the supported client range no longer needs it.

No remote rollout starts without an unambiguously identified Staging target. Mobile compatibility `PASS` and separate project-owner Production approval are required before Production application.

## Change classes

| Class | Meaning | Required handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | Editorial/evidence-only | Review; no runtime migration |
| B | Additive optional capability | Minor contract increment, defaults, fixtures |
| C | Breaking schema, Auth, RLS, formula, currency, timezone, rounding, or required-field change | New version, migration, compatibility plan, dual-client verification |
| D | Security emergency | Immediate containment, explicit impact, incident evidence, follow-up snapshot |

## Supported client range

During the pre-public Mobile phase, compatibility is governed by the explicit catch-up gate rather than a time window. After public Mobile release, the intended policy is current plus previous compatible contract versions. The exact support duration is `future_release_gate` and must be decided before the first public Mobile release.

`semverRangeFormat` is `npm-semver`. Draft versions are pre-release coordination artifacts and do not imply production support.

## Mobile review outcome

The technical review of snapshot `0.2.0-draft.2` completed with `PASS WITH NON-BLOCKING MISMATCHES`. Work and Statistics may continue as local compatibility references, and ordinary Class A Mobile or Web work may continue.

The earlier review resolved no shared backend blocker. Staging identity, migration history, privileges, work ownership, profile bootstrap, and RLS were subsequently reconciled at revision `202608020002`. Snapshot `0.2.0-draft.5` and its separately verified generated types now require a new Mobile acceptance pass; that pass is not Production approval.

## Mobile catch-up gate

Mobile cannot be accepted as contract-verified until all applicable items pass:

- Staging identity is unambiguously verified read-only. **Passed for this snapshot.**
- A fresh schema/type snapshot is generated from that Staging target. **Passed for this snapshot.**
- Checked-in migrations can explain the applied schema or the migration gap is explicitly repaired. **Passed through `202608020002`.**
- Auth confirmation, redirect, recovery, and deep-link behavior is verified.
- One canonical profile creation mechanism is selected and tested. **Passed on Staging; Mobile acceptance pending.**
- Work ownership nullability/default risks are removed. **Passed on Staging; nullable Garage ownership remains outside Mobile scope.**
- Two-account RLS tests pass for every Mobile-accessed table. **Passed on Staging for the current five-table Web surface.**
- Work and annual-report fixtures pass on both clients.
- Local-date/week/month boundary semantics are identical.
- Shared rounding and precision are decided before rental or income-after-expenses ships.
- Expenses and rental stay disabled until schema and fixtures are accepted.

## Deprecation rules

- A field is never repurposed to carry a different meaning.
- A legacy alias may be read during migration but canonical writes use the new term.
- Removing or making a field required is Class C.
- The legacy phrase “online tips” may be displayed only as migration copy; the canonical term is `app_tips`.
- Old clients must fail clearly when a required capability is unavailable; silent reinterpretation is forbidden.
